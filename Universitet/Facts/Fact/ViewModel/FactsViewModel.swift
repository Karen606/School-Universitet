There is no single date for the beginning of the school year in the United States: it is different in each state, the main thing is that schoolchildren study for at least 180 days in total. Somewhere they sit at their desks at the end of July, somewhere - in early August, and most often - at the end of August. Only in rare cases the school year starts in September.\n2.\nThey go to school from the age of 5. All children who have turned 5 are sent to the zero class, and in some schools there are even classes for kids 3-4 years old. During their school life pupils change at least 3 educational institutions: after the 5th grade they are transferred to secondary school, and after the 8th grade - to high school.\n3.\nThey choose their own subjects. In secondary school there are only 5 compulsory subjects: math, English, natural sciences, social sciences and physical education. The rest of the subjects the child chooses from the proposed list and further studies according to an individual schedule."), FactModel(title: "Facts about university", image: "FactsUniversity", description: "1. You can go to university without deciding on a major\n\nMost U.S. universities offer a flexible system of education, allowing people to decide on a major for up to two years. Students who have not chosen a major receive undeclared status and can take general education courses for the first two years. During this time, it is also possible to change majors (which, however, may extend the time of study).\n\n2. Apply early\n\nMost U.S. universities accept applications for the fall semester in October and November almost a year in advance, which many students are not prepared for. You can apply for both fall and spring semesters, so if you are late in applying, don't feel bad.\n\n3.Good grades in school do not guarantee admission to university\n\nSelection criteria in American universities differ from those in Uzbekistan and CIS countries in that the applicant with the highest grades will be preferred to the applicant with the best motivation, who will bring more value to the university. Proof of motivation will be volunteer work, diplomas, athletic achievements, and a good motivation letter. In addition, international students must prove a high level of English language proficiency by obtaining a good TOEFL/IELTS score."), FactModel(title: "Brain facts", image: "BrainFacts", description: "1- The brain's memory capacity is unlimited\nIn the brain, unlike computers and phones, you never run out of space. It is impossible to learn so much information that there is no place to put it. It's just important to remember that the brain needs sleep to better remember new information.\n\n2. The brain doesn't get tired from intellectual work\nFeelings of fatigue and apathy appear only because of emotions and experiences. The composition of the blood flowing through the brain does not change during mental work.\n\n3. Falling in love can be seen on fMRI\nSomeone believes that falling in love is a state of mind of a person. But in fact, when a person is in love, there are changes in the brain. If you do an fMRI, the images will show how the places where dopamine, the neurotransmitter that causes pleasant feelings, “light up”.\n\n4. The brain does not feel pain\nThere are no pain receptors in the brain. They are only present in the brain membranes and blood vessels. For example, when a person experiences a headache, it is not the brain itself that hurts, but the surrounding tissues.\n\n5. The brain is made up of 60 percent fats\nThe brain is the organ that contains the most fats. That's why a diet rich in healthy fats (omega-3 and omega-6) is so important for its health. They strengthen brain cell walls and carry and store fat-soluble vitamins.\n\n6. The brain cannot exist without oxygen or glucose\nNerve cells need these two substances to function and survive. If the brain does not receive enough oxygen or glucose within 3-5 minutes, irreversible damage occurs. It has been proven that death is almost never instantaneous. As long as there is still oxygen and glucose in the brain cells, the brain does not die for several more minutes.\n\n7. The brain generates between 25,000 and 50,000 thoughts per day\nIt is estimated that in most people, 70% of these thoughts are negative. In addition, more than 100,000 chemical reactions occur in the brain every second.\n\n8. Different parts of the brain are responsible for different functions\nHave you ever wondered what would happen to a person's consciousness if part of the brain were removed? Resection of certain parts of the brain will be accompanied by the loss of some of the brain's functions, because different parts of the brain are actually responsible for different functions, from hand movements to speech.\n")]
